# Journey 00 — Walking skeleton

**Story:** As a new user, I want to reach the app and complete the thinnest end-to-end path, so that the
architecture is proven before any module goes deep.

**Covers:** Layer 0 (walking skeleton) — the single end-to-end journey from the Layer-0 MVP contract.
Key endpoints/tools: `<health endpoint>`, `<primary route>`. _(Fill in for paperlens.)_

**Preconditions:** dev server running (started by `.claude/hooks/workspace-setup.sh`);
`.dev-workflow/ports.env` present; `scripts/seed.sh` has run.

> This journey ships as a **seed** — replace the `<…>` placeholders with the real Layer-0 path for
> paperlens. One green scenario end-to-end is the goal; don't chase coverage here.

## Scenario 00.1 — The app is reachable
- **Given** the dev server is up at `http://localhost:3001`
- **When** I open the app's entry route
- **Then** the landing/home surface renders without error
- **Verify (API/state):** `GET http://localhost:3000/<health>` returns `200`; the entry route's primary element
  is present in the UI snapshot.

## Scenario 00.2 — The thinnest user path completes
- **Given** I am on the entry surface (after 00.1)
- **When** I perform the single most important user action of the Layer-0 contract _(e.g. sign in, create
  the first record, submit the core form)_
- **Then** I reach the expected next surface with the expected state
- **Verify (API/state):** the corresponding API call returns success and the persisted state reflects the
  action (re-fetch or reload-and-re-snapshot — not just a rendered toast).

## Cleanup
Soft reset — re-run `scripts/seed.sh` to converge the fixture for the next journey.
