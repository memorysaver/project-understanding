# Project E2E Policy — paperlens

**This file is the single source of truth for how this project is tested.** `/aep-build` and `/aep-wrap`
read it to decide *which tiers gate a layer*, *what environment to dogfood against*, and *when*. It is
**skill-managed** — re-run `/aep-e2e-skill-scaffolding` to revisit it when the project's type or deploy
target changes. No copy lives in `AGENTS.md`: this skill is canonical cross-tool, so Claude Code, Codex,
and Pi all read this same file — that is what keeps behavior consistent across agents.

## The policy (confirmed at scaffold; edit as the project evolves)

| Decision             | This project              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Applicable tiers** | [1, 2, 3]                 |
| **Dogfood target**   | local                     |
| **Journey timing**   | pre-merge                 |

- **Applicable tiers** — only these tiers gate a layer (its `passed` needs them green + every acceptance
  criterion proven). A CLI/library is usually `1` only; an API service `1 + 3`; a web/mobile app
  `1 + 2 (+ 3)`. See the tier table in [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md).
- **Dogfood target** — where the Tier-2 journeys run:
  - `none` — no live UI verification (CLI/library, or backend-only). Tier-2 is **N/A**; a layer's gate is
    Tier-1 (+ Tier-3) + coverage. **No agent-browser / deployed check at all.**
  - `local` — against the local dev server (`$BASE_URL` from `.dev-workflow/ports.env`), pre-merge.
  - `deployed:<url>` — against a deployed environment (e.g. a Cloudflare prod/preview URL), typically
    after merge → deploy.
- **Journey timing** — `pre-merge` (the journey runs in `/aep-build` Phase 6 against `local`) or
  `post-deploy` (after merge → deploy, the layer gate runs the journey against the `deployed:<url>`
  target). With `post-deploy`, a merge sits at **`scripted_passed`** until the deployed dogfood flips it
  to `passed` — that intermediate state honestly says "machinery green, product not yet verified".

## Options reference

```
applicable_tiers : [1] | [1,3] | [1,2] | [1,2,3]     # which tiers gate a layer (project-type driven)
dogfood_target   : none | local | deployed:<url>      # where Tier-2 journeys run
journey_timing   : pre-merge | post-deploy            # when the journey half of the gate runs
```

> **paperlens note:** this is a web app on Cloudflare Workers (Hono server via Alchemy, TanStack Router
> web). The policy dogfoods `local` pre-merge for fast feedback. If a Workers-runtime-only issue
> (Durable Objects, D1 binding, edge headers) needs catching that local dev doesn't reproduce, switch
> `dogfood_target` to `deployed:<cloudflare-url>` + `journey_timing` to `post-deploy` by re-running
> `/aep-e2e-skill-scaffolding`.

## How the workflow honors it

- **`/aep-build` Phase 6** — if `dogfood_target == none`, skip the journey dogfood (Tier-2 N/A) and prove
  every criterion via Tier-1 / Tier-3 instead. Otherwise resolve the URL from `dogfood_target`
  (`local` → `$BASE_URL`; `deployed:<url>` → that URL) and run the journey with the tool from
  [`tool-selection.md`](./tool-selection.md).
- **`/aep-wrap` layer gate** — runs only the **applicable tiers**; with `journey_timing: post-deploy` it
  runs the journey against the `deployed:<url>` target after the merge/deploy, then flips
  `scripted_passed → passed`.
- **`/aep-dispatch`** — blocks the next layer until the gate is `passed` under this policy (a
  `scripted_passed` gate still blocks: "machinery green, dogfood pending").

> Changing this policy is a deliberate act — it changes what "done" means for every layer. Re-run
> `/aep-e2e-skill-scaffolding`; it re-confirms with you and never silently rewrites your choices.
