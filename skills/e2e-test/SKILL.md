description: E2E testing for paperlens — scripted gates (bun test), a declarative BDD journey dogfood driven by an agent (browser/device tool resolved per environment), and API drivers. Use when running tests, adding coverage, dogfooding a feature, running a user-story journey, seeding the test account, or executing the manual half of a layer gate.

# E2E Testing

> **Policy first.** [`policy.md`](./policy.md) is the single source of truth for *which tiers gate a
> layer*, *what environment to dogfood against* (`none` / `local` / `deployed:<url>`), and *when*
> (`pre-merge` / `post-deploy`). `/aep-build` and `/aep-wrap` read it. If a tier or the journey library is
> absent from this skill, `policy.md` says why.

Three tiers. Pick the one that matches the question being asked:

| Tier               | Proves                                  | Where                                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Scripted gates  | the MACHINERY (deterministic, CI-able)  | `bun test` tests (project framework)            |
| 2. Journey dogfood | the PRODUCT (real model/providers/env)  | [`journeys/`](./journeys/) (BDD user-story journeys) |
| 3. API drivers     | backend state, bulk setup, async flows  | `.dev-workflow/dogfood-*.{mjs,*}` (gitignored)  |

A green scripted gate is NOT proof the live product works — every layer gate has a manual journey half.
Conversely, never debug machinery against a live environment — write a scripted test.

## Tier 1 — Scripted gates (bun test)

Owned by the project's test framework. Run during `/aep-build` Phase 4 with the project's test command.
These cover deterministic machinery; they are not the dogfood.

## Tier 2 — Journey dogfood (declarative BDD, agent-executed)

The dogfood plan is a library of **natural-language, BDD-style user-story journeys** in
[`journeys/`](./journeys/), one per capability area, covering the shipped surface layer by layer. A
journey describes **intent** (Given / When / Then / **Verify**), **not** a click script — the executing
agent translates each step into the right tool calls.

**Which tool drives the UI is resolved by [`tool-selection.md`](./tool-selection.md)** — it picks the
browser/device automation tool from the journey's `target` (web/mobile/desktop), the host, and any pinned
preference, with health probes and graceful degrade. Journeys themselves stay tool-agnostic.

### Execution protocol (how an agent runs a journey)

1. **Pick** a journey + scenario(s) from [`journeys/`](./journeys/).
2. **Clean slate — seed the _target_ environment.** Run `scripts/seed.sh` against the **same** env the
   journey runs on (from `policy.md` `dogfood_target`): `local` → `bash scripts/seed.sh`;
   `deployed:<url>` → `SERVER_URL=<url> bash scripts/seed.sh` (never seed local while dogfooding a
   deployed target — the journey would verify against stale/absent fixtures). Where the product has a
   real sign-in, **auth is browser-simulated** through the UI — not an API auto-login.
3. **Read intent.** You are given Given/When/Then — *intent, not a recipe*. Translate each step into tool
   calls using the tool from `tool-selection.md`.
4. **Drive + verify.** Drive the UI with the resolved tool; assert backend state via the API. Ground
   rules: fresh element refs each step, scroll off-screen elements into view, **verify-state-before-claiming**.
5. **Record + report.** Screenshots + API JSON as evidence; report **PASS/FAIL per `Then`**, not "looks
   done". A `Verify` line that can't be confirmed is a FAIL.
6. **Close coverage.** Build the layer's coverage matrix — map each layer acceptance criterion to the
   scenario `Verify` (or a Tier-1 case / Tier-3 API check) that proves it. For any **uncovered**
   criterion, author the missing scenario/case now and run it; loop until every criterion is covered (or
   a `WAIVER: <reason>` is recorded). One green journey is not coverage.

### Layer gate (two-phase, covered)

A layer gate is **two-phase**, and green means *covered* — not "one journey passed":

- **`scripted_passed`** — the layer's Tier-1 framework tests are green (machinery proven).
- **`passed`** — `scripted_passed` **+** the applicable journey / API tiers green **+** every layer
  acceptance criterion proven (`coverage.criteria_covered == criteria_total`) **+** prior-layer journeys
  replay green (regression).

Run the matching journey, close any coverage gap (step 6), and record evidence in
`docs/layer-gates/<layer>.md` — the two matrices (**acceptance-traceability** + **scripted-coverage**),
the checklist, and any `WAIVER:` lines. Copy
[`layer-gate-evidence.template.md`](./layer-gate-evidence.template.md) per layer. `/aep-wrap` then
performs the two-phase flip and asks the human before advancing. Bugs found route through `/aep-reflect` (bug →
high-priority story; "works but feels wrong" → calibration). The full loop is in the
`aep-e2e-skill-scaffolding` skill's `references/layer-gate-loop.md`.

## Tier 3 — API drivers

For backend verification and things browsers are slow at (async/streamed turns, bulk setup, state-tree
diffs). Write `.dev-workflow/dogfood-<feature>.{mjs,…}`: sign in → call the API → assert. These are
**gitignored throwaways** — reusable patterns belong in this SKILL.md, not the scripts.

## Setup

Source ports before running any test:

```bash
source .dev-workflow/ports.env    # BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001  SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Account reset & seed

`scripts/seed.sh` converges the test account/database to a deterministic fixture via the public API
(idempotent — safe to re-run). Run it before scenario dogfoods; stale or empty data hides bugs.

```bash
bash scripts/seed.sh                                  # local (reads .dev-workflow/ports.env)
SERVER_URL=<prod-url> [SECRET=value …] bash scripts/seed.sh   # target a deployed env (prefix secret VAR=value assignments)
```

## Keeping this current

When a feature ships or changes behavior, update the matching journey in
[`journeys/`](./journeys/) in the same PR. A stale journey silently shrinks regression coverage. New
capability → new journey (copy the template in [`journeys/README.md`](./journeys/README.md)).
