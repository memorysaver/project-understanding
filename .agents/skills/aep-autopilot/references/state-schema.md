# Autopilot State Schema

All autopilot state files live in `.dev-workflow/` on the main workspace (repo root). This reuses the existing `.dev-workflow/` pattern already established for workspace agents.

---

## `.dev-workflow/autopilot-state.json`

Machine-readable state file. Read and written by the autopilot tick.

## `.dev-workflow/autopilot-status.md`

Human-readable status file. Updated at the end of every tick.

```markdown
# Autopilot Status

**Status:** Running
**Started:** 2026-04-01 10:00
**Last tick:** 2026-04-01 10:25 (tick #5)

## Active Workspaces

| Workspace       | Story    | Phase           | Progress | Last Action      |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| auth-middleware | PROJ-003 | 5 (code-review) | 60%      | review triggered |
| user-model      | PROJ-004 | 10 (pr-created) | 90%      | detected_merged  |

## Escalations

### PROJ-010: Design Needed (UNRESOLVED)

**Why:** Complexity L with 1 acceptance criterion, UI-heavy activity 'Settings'
**What needs attention:** Story 'Add settings page' needs UI/UX decisions — layout structure, form grouping, navigation pattern
**Expected action:** Run `/design PROJ-010` to refine the spec, then `/autopilot start`

## Stats

- Stories completed: 3
- Stories failed: 0
- Total cost: $12.50
- Total ticks: 5
```

When **paused**, the status file includes additional sections:

```markdown
## PAUSED — Human Attention Required

**Paused at:** 2026-04-01 10:15
**Reason:** Design escalation for PROJ-010

### Why autopilot paused

Story PROJ-010 'Add settings page' was next in the dispatch queue (score: 8.5) but
does not meet the criteria for autonomous implementation:

- Complexity: L (large scope)
- Acceptance criteria: 1 (minimum 3 required for autonomous dispatch)
- Activity: 'Settings' (UI-heavy — requires visual design decisions)

### What decisions need human input

1. **Page layout:** Single page vs tabbed sections vs sidebar navigation
2. **Form grouping:** How to organize settings (profile, notifications, privacy, etc.)
3. **Interaction patterns:** Inline editing vs modal dialogs vs save-all-at-once

### How to resume

1. Run `/design PROJ-010` to work through the design interactively
2. Or add at least 3 specific acceptance criteria to product-context.yaml
3. Then run `/autopilot start` to resume orchestration

### Current state while paused

- 2 workspaces still running (PROJ-003, PROJ-004)
- 3 stories completed so far
- Paused workspaces will continue autonomously
```

## Tick Lock Mechanism

The `tick_in_progress` field prevents overlapping ticks:

1. **Before tick:** Read `tick_in_progress`. If set and less than 4 minutes old, skip this tick.
2. **Start of tick:** Set `tick_in_progress` to current timestamp. Write state immediately.
3. **End of tick:** Set `tick_in_progress` to null. Write state.

If a tick crashes (lock never released), the next tick after 4 minutes will clear the stale lock and proceed.

---

## Atomic Write Protocol

To prevent state corruption from mid-write crashes:

```bash
# Write to temp file
cat > .dev-workflow/autopilot-state.json.tmp << 'EOF'
{ ... }
EOF

# Atomic rename (POSIX guarantees this is atomic)
mv .dev-workflow/autopilot-state.json.tmp .dev-workflow/autopilot-state.json
```

The autopilot skill instructs the agent to use this pattern. In practice, the agent writes the file and the filesystem handles atomicity.
