name: aep-dispatch
description: Pick the next story to work on and bridge it into the feature lifecycle. Use when ready to start building, or when the user says "what's next", "dispatch", "pick a story", "start next feature", "what should I work on". Reads product-context.yaml, syncs workspace signals, computes readiness score for routing, then scores stories by business value + unblock potential + critical path urgency + reuse leverage (penalized by ambiguity + interface risk), assembles context, and hands off to /aep-design or /aep-launch. Supports batch dispatch with WIP limits. For autonomous orchestration, use /aep-autopilot instead.

# Dispatch

Bridge between the product context (control plane) and the feature lifecycle (execution plane). Syncs workspace state, scores stories, picks what to build next, assembles context, and routes into `/aep-design` or `/aep-launch`.

**Where this fits:**

```
/aep-envision → /aep-map → /aep-scaffold
  → [ /aep-dispatch → /aep-design → /aep-launch → /aep-build → /aep-wrap ]
       ▲ you are here
  → /aep-reflect → loop
```

**Session:** Main, interactive
**Input:** Product definition from `product/index.yaml` (split mode) or `product-context.yaml` (v1 mode); operational state from `product-context.yaml`
**Output:** OpenSpec change with pre-assembled context, story status updated, handoff to `/aep-design` or `/aep-launch`

> **For autonomous orchestration:** Use `/aep-autopilot` instead. Autopilot runs the full dispatch-launch-monitor-review-wrap-dispatch cycle as a tick-based state machine via `/loop`. Dispatch remains a single-pass interactive tool.
>
> **For hands-free batch under Claude Code:** dispatch a wave **"with workflow"** to build the whole wave as a single dynamic workflow (executor **workflow** mode) instead of N monitorable workers. See Step 5 → _Dynamic Workflow_ mode.

---

## Before Starting

**File Resolution:**

```bash
ls product/index.yaml 2>/dev/null && echo "SPLIT MODE" || echo "V1 MODE"
cat product-context.yaml
```

- **Split mode** (`product/index.yaml` exists): Read product definition from `product/index.yaml` for context assembly. Read stories, topology, architecture, cost from `product-context.yaml`.
- **V1 mode**: Read everything from `product-context.yaml`.

If `product-context.yaml` doesn't exist, run `/aep-envision` then `/aep-map` first.
If the `stories` section is empty, run `/aep-map` to decompose the product.

---

## The Dispatch Protocol

Every dispatch run follows the same 7-step protocol. Each step is idempotent — running `/aep-dispatch` twice with no state changes produces the same result.

```
① SYNC signals    → bring YAML up to date with workspace reality
② CASCADE states  → compute all pending→ready, pending→blocked transitions
③ SCORE stories   → rank the ready queue by dispatch_score
④ PRESENT queue   → show user the scored dispatch queue
⑤ DISPATCH        → lock stories (status→in_progress), create OpenSpec changes
⑥ MONITOR         → agents work, main session watches signals
⑦ COMPLETE        → /aep-wrap updates YAML, atomic cascade, re-invoke dispatch
```

---

## Step 1: Signal Sync

Before calculating anything, sync workspace signals into the YAML to reflect reality:

```
For each story with status: in_progress or in_review:
  workspace = story.assigned_to
  signal_path = .feature-workspaces/<workspace>/.dev-workflow/signals/status.json

  Read signal file (if exists):
    If signal.story_status == "completed":
      Update YAML: story.status → completed
      Update: story.completed_at = signal.completed_at
      Update: story.pr_url = signal.pr_url
      Update: story.cost_usd = signal.cost_usd
    If signal.story_status == "in_review":
      Update YAML: story.status → in_review
      Update: story.pr_url = signal.pr_url
    If signal.story_status == "failed":
      Update YAML: story.status → failed
      Append signal.failure_log to story.failure_logs
```

**Why:** Without signal sync, the YAML shows `in_progress` for stories already done. Downstream stories stay `pending` even though they're actually ready.

---

## Step 2: Cascade State Transitions

After syncing all signals, compute all state transitions in one pass:

```
For each story with status: pending:
  If any story in dependencies[] has status: failed:
    Transition → blocked
  Elif any story in dependencies[] has status: deferred:
    Transition → blocked (dependency deferred)
  Elif all stories in dependencies[] have status: completed:
    Transition → ready

For each story with status: blocked:
  If the blocking dependency is now completed:
    Transition → pending (will be re-evaluated in this same pass)
```

**Recovery transitions** (user-initiated, handle if requested):

- `failed → pending` — user resets after fixing the spec
- `deferred → pending` — user un-defers a story

**Validate** the YAML after all updates (see `references/yaml-guardrails.md`):

```bash
npx js-yaml product-context.yaml > /dev/null && echo "YAML OK"
```

If this fails, fix the YAML before proceeding. Common fixes: quote list items containing colons, flatten nested sub-lists, escape embedded double quotes.

**Commit** the synced + cascaded state to YAML before computing scores. Increment `dispatch_epoch`.

---

## Step 3: Score Stories

### Determine Active Layer

```
For each layer (0, 1, 2, ...):
  If any story in this layer has status not in [completed, deferred]:
    This is the active layer. Stop.
```

**Layer gate check:** If active layer > 0, verify `layer_gates[active_layer - 1].status == passed`. If not, block and suggest running the layer gate test.

### Filter Ready Queue

From `ready` stories in the active layer, remove stories with file-level conflicts:

```
For each ready story:
  For each in_progress story:
    If files_affected intersection is non-empty:
      Mark as conflicted — cannot dispatch until the in_progress story completes
```

### Compute Readiness Score

Before scoring, compute each story's readiness (spec completeness):

```
readiness_score = (
  min(3, acceptance_criteria_count)      # 0-3
  + (interface_obligations_defined ? 2 : 0)  # 0 or 2
  + (files_affected_identified ? 1 : 0)      # 0 or 1
  + (verification_defined ? 2 : 0)           # 0 or 2
  + (no_relevant_open_questions ? 2 : 0)     # 0 or 2
) / 10
```

Write `readiness_score` to the story in YAML. This is used for routing in Step 7.

### Compute Dispatch Score

Each remaining ready story gets a score:

```
dispatch_score = (business_value + unblock_potential + critical_path_urgency + reuse_leverage) / (complexity_cost + ambiguity_penalty + interface_risk)
```

#### Business Value (1-10)

Use `story.business_value` if explicitly set. Otherwise derive from priority:

```
critical = 10
high     = 7
medium   = 4
low      = 1
```

#### Unblock Potential (0-10)

```
unblock_potential = min(10, count of stories that directly depend on this one * 2)
```

A story that unblocks 5 others scores 10. A leaf story scores 0.

#### Critical Path Urgency (0-10)

Compute the critical path through the dependency DAG (longest chain from any root to any leaf within the active layer). Stories on the critical path get maximum urgency:

```
If story is on critical path:
  critical_path_urgency = 10
Else:
  slack = latest_possible_start - earliest_possible_start
  critical_path_urgency = max(0, 10 - slack)
```

#### Reuse Leverage (0-10)

Stories that produce shared enablers (auth middleware, base components, shared utilities) score higher:

```
reuse_leverage = min(10, count_of_modules_depending_on_output * 3)
```

Only applies to stories with `compile_mode: shared_enabler` or whose module appears in 2+ other modules' `depends_on`.

#### Complexity Cost (denominator term)

```
S = 1    (fast feedback)
M = 2
L = 4    (slow, expensive)
```

#### Ambiguity Penalty (0-5, denominator term)

```
ambiguity_penalty = 0
If acceptance_criteria count < 3:     +2
If interface_obligations empty:       +1
If relevant open_questions exist:     +1
If files_affected empty:              +1
```

Stories with high ambiguity get lower scores, biasing dispatch toward well-specified work.

#### Interface Risk (0-3, denominator term)

```
interface_risk = min(3, count of interface contracts this story creates or modifies)
```

Cross-module interface changes carry integration risk in parallel execution.

#### Example Scores

| Story                                                      | Value | Unblock | CP  | Reuse | Cost | Ambig | IFace | Score    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------- | --- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| Auth middleware (critical path, high, unblocks 3, enabler) | 7     | 6       | 10  | 6     | S=1  | 0     | 1     | **14.5** |
| User model (not critical, medium, unblocks 2)              | 4     | 4       | 4   | 0     | S=1  | 0     | 0     | **12.0** |
| Dashboard layout (not critical, low, leaf, ambiguous)      | 1     | 0       | 2   | 0     | L=4  | 3     | 0     | **0.43** |

### Grouped Change Dispatch

For stories with `compile_mode: grouped_change` sharing the same `change_group`:

- **Readiness gate:** Use **min readiness_score** of any story in the group — if any story is under-specified, the group isn't ready
- **Dispatch score:** Sum `business_value` and `unblock_potential` across the group; use max `critical_path_urgency` and max `reuse_leverage`; divide by sum of `complexity_cost` + max `ambiguity_penalty` + max `interface_risk`
- Dispatch the entire group as one unit — one OpenSpec change, one workspace, one PR
- Max 3 stories per group. Failure of any story fails the group.

---

## Step 4: Present Dispatch Queue

Show the sorted queue with context:

```
Dispatch Queue (Layer 0 — 4 ready, 2 in_progress, WIP 3/5)

  1. ★ PROJ-003 "Setup auth middleware"           score: 14.5
     [high] S | Module: auth | Wave 1 | Critical path | Shared enabler
     Unblocks: PROJ-005, PROJ-007, PROJ-008
     → Readiness: 0.9 — skip to /aep-launch

  2.   PROJ-004 "Create user model"                score: 12.0
     [medium] S | Module: db | Wave 1 | 4h slack
     Unblocks: PROJ-006, PROJ-009
     → Readiness: 0.8 — skip to /aep-launch

  3.   PROJ-010 "Add settings page"                score: 0.43
     [low] L | Module: web | Wave 3 | Leaf
     → Readiness: 0.3 — go through /aep-design (ambiguous)

  Conflicted (waiting):
  • PROJ-006 — files overlap with in_progress PROJ-002

  Blocked (dependencies not met):
  • PROJ-008 — waiting on PROJ-003 (auth middleware)

  In progress:
  • PROJ-001 (tab: feat-api-scaffold) — Phase 4, 60% complete
  • PROJ-002 (tab: feat-db-schema) — Phase 5, code review
```

**Recommendation:** Always highlight the top story and explain why (highest score = critical path + high value + unblocks the most).

---

## Step 5: Dispatch

### Dispatch Modes

#### Interactive (default)

User picks stories one at a time. Best for early layers or learning the system.

#### Wave Batch (`--batch wave`)

Dispatch all ready stories in the current wave (execution slice) at once:

```
Dispatches all ready stories in Wave N (up to WIP limit)
Creates N workspaces via /aep-launch
```

#### Dynamic Workflow (`--batch wave` + "…with workflow")

When the user explicitly asks to dispatch a wave **"with workflow"** AND the host
is Claude Code with the dynamic-workflow (Workflow) tool, route the batch through
the **workflow mode** instead of creating N workers. The dispatch front-end is
identical — sync, cascade, score, lock, assemble context — only the execution
plane changes: instead of N `/aep-launch` workers, author one dynamic workflow that
fans out `pipeline(stories, build, verify)` with one agent per story (recipe:
`aep-executor/references/backends.md` → "Mode: workflow").

```
Locks + creates OpenSpec changes for the ready stories in Wave N — up to the WIP limit (as usual)
Creates the .feature-workspaces/<name> worktrees (launch guardrails apply)
Then: one dynamic workflow, one agent per locked story (build → verify), each bound to its worktree
After the run: collect `gated` results → ask the human → resume gated stories with the answers
```

**Respect the WIP limit.** Workflow mode does not exempt the wave from the WIP cap below:
each workflow agent still opens a PR, so the integration/merge bottleneck is the
same as Wave Batch. Lock at most `available_slots` stories into the workflow
(`available_slots = concurrency_limit − current in_progress`); the workflow's own
per-agent concurrency cap is a separate, lower-level limit and does not replace
this one.

**Announce the mode (this path bypasses `/aep-launch`).** Because dispatch authors
the workflow directly instead of handing to `/aep-launch`, dispatch owns the
announcement that `/aep-launch` normally makes: state "workflow mode (dynamic
workflow) — autonomous, billed, background; **no mid-stage steering**; human
gates **park and return here** for confirmation, then gated stories resume"
before authoring the workflow.

This is the hands-free batch path: autonomous, billed, background. Steering is
at stage boundaries only — but human decisions are NOT lost: a worker that hits
one returns a `gated` result (gate-and-park), this session asks you, and the
story resumes in its worktree with your answer. Use it when you want a wave
built autonomously without watching individual workers. Requires Claude Code +
Workflow tool (see `.claude/skills/aep-executor/references/backends.md`,
"Mode: workflow"). If the host can't support it, fall back to Wave Batch and
say so.

### WIP Limits

```
max_wip = topology.routing.concurrency_limit  (default: 5)
current_wip = count of stories with status: in_progress
available_slots = max_wip - current_wip

Never dispatch more than available_slots stories.
```

**Why (Little's Law):** `Lead Time = WIP / Throughput`. If you merge 3 stories/day, WIP 3 = 1 day lead time. WIP 15 = 5 days. The bottleneck is usually human PR review, not agent speed.

### The Dispatch Lock

For each selected story, dispatch atomically:

```
1. Re-read story.status from YAML (not from cache)
2. If status != ready → SKIP (already dispatched by another run)
3. Write to YAML:
     status: in_progress
     assigned_to: <workspace-name>
     openspec_change: <story-id>
     started_at: <ISO 8601 now>
     dispatched_at_epoch: <current dispatch_epoch>
4. Commit YAML immediately (this IS the lock)
5. THEN create OpenSpec change and workspace
```

The commit happens BEFORE the workspace is created. Two consecutive `/aep-dispatch` runs: Run 1 writes `in_progress` and commits. Run 2 reads `in_progress`, skips. No double dispatch.

---

## Step 6: Create OpenSpec Change with Context Package

For each dispatched story, create the OpenSpec change with pre-assembled context:

```
openspec/changes/<story-id>/
├── proposal.md          ← story description + why + business value
├── design.md            ← module definition + interface contracts + dependency APIs
├── specs/<module>.md    ← acceptance criteria + interface obligations + verification
├── tasks.md             ← story decomposed into implementation tasks
└── .context/            ← pre-assembled context package
    ├── stable-prefix.md ← shared product/architecture context (cacheable)
    ├── dependencies.md  ← public APIs from completed dependency stories
    └── retrieval.md     ← what to explore at runtime
```

### Context Assembly

#### Part 1: Stable Prefix (~10K tokens, shared across agents in same layer)

Extracted from product definition (`product/index.yaml` in split mode, `product-context.yaml` in v1 mode):

- `product.problem` — what we're solving
- `product.constraints` — tech stack, infrastructure
- `product.layers[active_layer]` — what the user can do at this layer
- `architecture.overview` — high-level structure
- `architecture.technical_spec` — if set, include the technical specification document (or relevant sections for the story's module). This provides Symphony-style precision for protocol-heavy systems.
- Coding conventions (conventional commits, git + worktree workflow, trunk-based)

#### Part 2: Story-Specific Payload (~20K tokens, unique per agent)

- **Full story spec** from the `stories` section
- **Module definition** from `architecture.modules` matching `story.module`
- **Adjacent interfaces** from `architecture.interfaces` where `from` or `to` = story module
- **Dependency outputs** — for each completed dependency: public API surface (types, exports, endpoints). NOT internal implementation.

#### Part 3: Retrieval Instructions (~500 tokens)

```markdown
## Files to read first

- <files_affected from story spec>

## Patterns to explore

- Check existing patterns in <module> directory
- Read interface contract tests for consumed interfaces

## Do not read

- Other module internals — use dependency_outputs above
```

#### Calibration Context (for `.5` alignment layers and calibrated stories)

For stories with `calibration_type` set, or stories in `.5` alignment layers:

**Heavy calibrations** (visual-design, ux-flow, copy-tone):

1. **Include the calibration artifact** — `calibration/<type>.yaml` (e.g., `calibration/visual-design.yaml`)
2. **For visual-design:** Also include reference design files from `docs/design-references/` matching the story's page (by story activity or title)
3. **Include calibration constraint directive:**

   ```markdown
   This story has calibrated <dimension> decisions.
   Follow the calibration artifact in calibration/<type>.yaml strictly.
   Do not introduce new [visual tokens / flow patterns / voice patterns]
   not defined in the calibration artifact.
   ```

If the required `calibration/<type>.yaml` does not exist, **do not dispatch** — instruct the user to run `/aep-calibrate <type>` first.

**Light calibrations** (api-surface, data-model, scope-direction, performance-quality):

No additional context needed — decisions are already in the architecture section of `product-context.yaml` and the product section of `product/index.yaml` (split mode), which flow through the stable prefix (Part 1) and story-specific payload (Part 2).

**Backward compatibility:** For `.5` layer stories without `calibration_type` set, default to visual-design. Check both `calibration/visual-design.yaml` and `design-context.yaml` (legacy path).

### Assembly Rules

1. **Prune aggressively** — irrelevant context degrades agent performance
2. **Dependency outputs = public API only** — types, exports, endpoint signatures, never internals
3. **Measure the package** — if it exceeds the role's token budget from topology, prune harder or split the story
4. **Stable prefix is cacheable** — when dispatching multiple stories in the same layer, write it once

---

## Commit and Push Before Handoff

> **CRITICAL:** Commit and push ALL dispatch artifacts (YAML updates, OpenSpec changes, changelog) to remote BEFORE handing off to `/aep-launch`. If the dispatch commit stays local, it will be lost when workspace PRs merge to the integration branch and you rebase. The push ensures OpenSpec changes survive on the remote.

Append to the `changelog` section:

```yaml
- date: <today>
  type: dispatch
  author: human
  summary: "Dispatched PROJ-003 (auth middleware), PROJ-004 (user model) — Layer 0, Wave 1"
  sections_changed: [stories]
```

Commit and push:

```bash
# Resolve $BASE (integration branch) — see git-ref "Integration Branch" (override → develop → main)
BASE=$(git config --get aep.integration-branch 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -z "$BASE" ] && { git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/develop \
  || git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/develop; } && BASE=develop
BASE=${BASE:-main}

git pull --ff-only origin "$BASE"
git add product-context.yaml openspec/changes/
git commit -m "feat: dispatch PROJ-003, PROJ-004 — Layer 0 Wave 1"
git push origin "$BASE"
```

**Verify the push succeeded** before proceeding to handoff. If push fails (e.g., remote conflict), resolve before launching workspaces.

---

## Step 7: Hand Off

> **Launch mode is normally resolved at `/aep-launch`, not here.** For the default
> path dispatch stays executor-agnostic — it hands a well-specified change to
> `/aep-launch`, which detects the host and selects a mode (claude-team /
> claude-bg / codex-subagent / codex-exec / legacy) via `aep-executor`. Native
> modes outrank tmux on every host; dispatch does not need to know. **The one
> exception is the _Dynamic Workflow_ opt-in (Step 5):** that path runs the
> **workflow** mode _from dispatch_, bypassing `/aep-launch`, so dispatch itself
> owns mode selection and the announcement for that case.

Determine the handoff based on story completeness:

### Readiness-based routing

Use the `readiness_score` computed in Step 3:

- **readiness_score >= 0.7** → skip to `/aep-launch` (spec is dispatch-ready)
- **readiness_score 0.5–0.7** → present to user for decision (`/aep-launch` or `/aep-design`)
- **readiness_score < 0.5** → route to `/aep-design` (spec needs refinement)

### Well-specified (readiness >= 0.7) → skip to /aep-launch

- 3+ specific, testable acceptance criteria
- Interface obligations defined
- Verification strategy complete
- Files affected identified

### Ambiguous (readiness < 0.5) → go through /aep-design

- Vague or fewer than 3 acceptance criteria
- Missing interface details
- Open questions relevant to this story

```
Story PROJ-003 dispatched (score: 14.5, critical path, shared enabler).

OpenSpec change: openspec/changes/PROJ-003/
Context package: openspec/changes/PROJ-003/.context/

Recommendation: Readiness 0.9 — well-specified
  → Skip to /aep-launch

  /aep-launch    ← start building immediately
  /aep-design    ← refine the spec first
```

### Batch Handoff

For batch dispatch, create all workspaces via `/aep-launch`:

```
Batch dispatched: PROJ-003 (score 23.0), PROJ-004 (score 12.0)

  /aep-launch PROJ-003  → tab: auth-middleware
  /aep-launch PROJ-004  → tab: user-model
```

---

## Edge Cases

- **No stories ready:** All pending stories have unmet dependencies. Check if any `in_progress` stories are stuck (high attempt_count, old started_at). Suggest checking workspace progress or running `/aep-reflect`.
- **All stories completed in active layer:** Trigger layer gate test. If passed, advance to next layer and re-run dispatch.
- **All stories completed in all layers:** Product is done. Suggest `/aep-reflect` for final review.
- **Layer gate failed:** Do not advance. Create fix stories based on gate failure, add to current layer, re-dispatch.
- **WIP limit reached:** No available slots. Show what's in progress and suggest waiting or reviewing PRs to unblock slots.

---

## Guardrails

- **Never dispatch a story with unmet dependencies** — even if the user insists.
- **Never dispatch conflicting stories in parallel** — file-level conflicts cause merge chaos.
- **Always sync signals before computing** — stale YAML produces wrong dispatch decisions.
- **Always commit YAML before creating workspaces** — the commit IS the dispatch lock.
- **Always create the OpenSpec change** — even for well-specified stories. The `.context/` directory is what the agent reads.
- **Respect WIP limits** — dispatching beyond integration capacity creates traffic jams, not speed.
