description: Reference guide for setting up project-level quality infrastructure. Use when creating a new project's test setup, adding test layers, or when the user asks "how do I add tests?", "set up e2e", "testing strategy", "quality gates". Covers workspace setup hook, e2e-test skill creation, and the testing pyramid mapped to /build phases.

# Testing Guide

How to set up the project-level quality infrastructure that the workflow plugin (`/design` → `/launch` → `/build` → `/wrap`) relies on.

**Where this fits:**

```
/onboard → /scaffold → /testing-guide → [ /design → /launch → /build → /wrap ]
                        ▲ you are here
```

`/scaffold` creates the project. This guide creates the quality infrastructure. `/build` uses it during feature development.

---

## Two Things to Set Up

Every project needs two things before `/build` can run autonomously:

1. **Workspace Setup Hook** — `.claude/hooks/workspace-setup.sh`
2. **E2E Test Skill** — `.claude/skills/e2e-test/`

---

## Part 1: Workspace Setup Hook

### What it is

A convention-based script that `/build` calls during Phase 0 (workspace init) and session recovery (`init.sh`). The workflow plugin doesn't know your stack — this script does.

### Contract

The hook **MUST**:

- Install dependencies (bun/npm/pnpm/cargo/poetry/etc.)
- Start the dev server (or verify it's running)
- Write `.dev-workflow/ports.env` with at minimum:
  ```
  WEB_PORT=<port>
  SERVER_PORT=<port>
  BASE_URL=http://localhost:<web-port>
  SERVER_URL=http://localhost:<server-port>
  ```
- Handle port scanning for parallel workspace isolation

The hook **MAY**:

- Validate `.env` files against `.env.example` templates
- Run database migrations
- Seed test accounts
- Clean container/cache state
- Copy config from main workspace (for worktree/workspace isolation)

### Template

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Workspace Setup Hook
# Called by /build Phase 0 and init.sh (session recovery)
#
# Contract: MUST write .dev-workflow/ports.env
set -euo pipefail

REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)"
cd "$REPO_ROOT"

# ── Detect workspace vs main ──
# AEP runs feature work in git worktrees at .feature-workspaces/<name>/.
# `git worktree list --porcelain` lists the main checkout first, so its first
# entry is the canonical main repo. Compare to detect whether we're in a worktree.
MAIN_REPO="$(git worktree list --porcelain 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed 's/^worktree //')" || MAIN_REPO="$REPO_ROOT"
IS_WORKSPACE=false
[ "$REPO_ROOT" != "$MAIN_REPO" ] && IS_WORKSPACE=true

# ── PROJECT-SPECIFIC: Validate .env files ──
# Example for monorepo with multiple .env files:
# for example in apps/server/.env.example apps/web/.env.example; do
#   env="${example%.example}"
#   [ ! -f "$env" ] && cp "$example" "$env"
# done

# ── PROJECT-SPECIFIC: Install dependencies ──
# bun install
# npm install
# cargo build
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# ── Port scanning (parallel workspace isolation) ──
SERVER_PORT=3000
WEB_PORT=3001
while lsof -i :"$SERVER_PORT" -sTCP:LISTEN >/dev/null 2>&1 || \
      lsof -i :"$WEB_PORT" -sTCP:LISTEN >/dev/null 2>&1; do
  SERVER_PORT=$((SERVER_PORT + 10))
  WEB_PORT=$((SERVER_PORT + 1))
done

# ── PROJECT-SPECIFIC: Update config with assigned ports ──
# sed -i '' "s|^SERVER_PORT=.*|SERVER_PORT=$SERVER_PORT|" apps/server/.env
# sed -i '' "s|^WEB_PORT=.*|WEB_PORT=$WEB_PORT|" apps/web/.env

# ── Write ports.env (CONTRACT — required) ──
mkdir -p .dev-workflow
cat > .dev-workflow/ports.env <<EOF
SERVER_PORT=$SERVER_PORT
WEB_PORT=$WEB_PORT
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:$SERVER_PORT
BASE_URL=http://localhost:$WEB_PORT
EOF

# ── PROJECT-SPECIFIC: Start dev server ──
# if ! lsof -ti :$SERVER_PORT >/dev/null 2>&1; then
#   bun run dev &
# fi

# ── PROJECT-SPECIFIC: Seed database ──
# SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/../skills/e2e-test/scripts" && pwd)"
# [ -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/seed.sh" ] && bash "$SCRIPT_DIR/seed.sh"

echo "Setup complete. Server: http://localhost:$SERVER_PORT  Web: http://localhost:$WEB_PORT"
```

Make executable: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/workspace-setup.sh`

### Idempotency

The hook will be called:

- Once during `/build` Phase 0 (initial setup)
- Again on every `init.sh` run (session recovery after context reset)

Design it to be safe to run multiple times — check if the dev server is already running before starting a new one, don't fail if dependencies are already installed.

---

## Part 2: E2E Test Skill

### What it is

A project-level skill that lives in `.claude/skills/e2e-test/`. It documents what tests exist, how to run them, and how to add new ones. The build agent reads this skill during Phases 6-8 to understand testing capabilities.

### Directory structure

```
.claude/skills/e2e-test/
├── SKILL.md              # Documents test infrastructure + how to add tests
└── scripts/
    ├── seed.sh           # DB migrations + test account creation (idempotent)
    └── <feature>-e2e.sh  # One script per feature (added during /build Phase 7)
```

### SKILL.md template

```markdown
---
name: e2e-test
description: E2E testing infrastructure for [PROJECT_NAME]. Use when running
  tests, adding test coverage, or understanding what tests exist. Contains
  setup scripts, test scripts, and patterns for adding new tests.
---

# E2E Test Infrastructure

## Prerequisites

- Dev server running (started by workspace-setup.sh hook)
- `.dev-workflow/ports.env` exists (written by workspace-setup.sh)
- [PROJECT-SPECIFIC: any other prerequisites]

## Setup

Source ports before running any test:

\`\`\`bash
source .dev-workflow/ports.env
\`\`\`

## Test Scripts

| Script           | What it tests                | Tools                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| seed.sh          | DB migrations + test account | curl, sqlite3                |
| [feature]-e2e.sh | [description]                | curl, optional agent-browser |

## Adding a New Test

1. Create `.claude/skills/e2e-test/scripts/<feature>-e2e.sh`
2. Follow the E2E script pattern (see below)
3. Add the script to the table above
4. Run it: `bash .claude/skills/e2e-test/scripts/<feature>-e2e.sh`

## E2E Script Pattern

All scripts follow this structure — copy it when creating new tests.

## Test Account

| Field    | Value              |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Email    | [PROJECT-SPECIFIC] |
| Password | [PROJECT-SPECIFIC] |
```

### E2E Script Pattern

Every E2E test script should follow this pattern:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# <Feature Name> E2E Test
#
# Prerequisites: dev server running, admin account seeded
# What it tests:
#   - [test 1]
#   - [test 2]
#   - [test 3]

set -euo pipefail

# ── Port resolution ──
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
if [ -f "$REPO_ROOT/.dev-workflow/ports.env" ]; then
  source "$REPO_ROOT/.dev-workflow/ports.env"
fi
BASE_URL="${BASE_URL:-http://localhost:3001}"
SERVER_URL="${SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:3000}"

# ── Test helpers ──
PASS=0 FAIL=0 SKIP=0
pass() { echo "  PASS: $1"; PASS=$((PASS + 1)); }
fail() { echo "  FAIL: $1"; FAIL=$((FAIL + 1)); }
skip() { echo "  SKIP: $1"; SKIP=$((SKIP + 1)); }

agent_browser_healthy() {
  command -v agent-browser >/dev/null 2>&1 || return 1
  agent-browser navigate about:blank >/tmp/agent-browser-smoke.log 2>&1
}

# ── 1. [Test Group Name] ──
echo "=== 1. [Test Group] ==="

# API-level test (curl)
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$SERVER_URL/api/health")
if [ "$RESPONSE" = "200" ]; then
  pass "Health endpoint returns 200"
else
  fail "Health endpoint returned $RESPONSE"
fi

# Browser-level test (agent-browser)
if agent_browser_healthy; then
  agent-browser navigate "$BASE_URL/login"
  # ... browser assertions ...
  pass "Login page loads"
else
  skip "Login page (agent-browser unavailable or Chrome launch failed)"
fi

# ── 2. [Next Test Group] ──
echo "=== 2. [Next Group] ==="
# ...

# ── Results ──
echo ""
echo "=== Results ==="
echo "  Passed:  $PASS"
echo "  Failed:  $FAIL"
echo "  Skipped: $SKIP"
[ "$FAIL" -gt 0 ] && exit 1
exit 0
```

### Key patterns

- **Auto-source ports.env** — never hardcode ports
- **Graceful degradation** — skip tests when tools are unavailable (SKIP, not FAIL)
- **Idempotent** — safe to run multiple times
- **Self-contained** — each script tests one feature, can run independently
- **CI-ready** — exit 1 on failure, exit 0 on success

---

## Part 3: Testing Layers

Two categories of tests, owned by different parts of the system:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Project test framework          │  │ e2e-test skill                   │
│ (vitest, jest, pytest, etc.)    │  │ (.claude/skills/e2e-test/)       │
│                                 │  │                                  │
│ Unit tests                      │  │ API integration tests (curl)     │
│  - co-located with source       │  │ E2E browser tests (optional)     │
│  - run during Phase 4           │  │                                  │
│  - use project's test command   │  │  - live in scripts/              │
│                                 │  │  - run during Phase 5-8          │
│ Plugin doesn't manage this.     │  │  Plugin orchestrates this.       │
│ See your framework's docs.      │  │  This guide covers this.         │
└─────────────────────────────────┘  └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Unit Tests (Phase 4 — project framework)

Unit tests are owned by the project's test framework — vitest, jest, pytest, cargo test, go test. The monorepo setup from `/scaffold` (or the project's own config) already configures the test runner.

During `/build` Phase 4, the build agent runs the project's test command after implementing each task. No special setup from the e2e-test skill is needed.

> The plugin doesn't teach unit testing. Your framework's docs do that.

### API Integration Tests (Phase 5 — e2e-test skill)

| Aspect         | Detail                                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What**       | Endpoint contracts: request/response shapes, auth, error codes         |
| **Runner**     | curl scripts or test framework with HTTP client                        |
| **Scope**      | API boundaries, auth flows, error handling, data persistence           |
| **Convention** | `scripts/api/` or `__tests__/api/` or inline in E2E scripts            |
| **When**       | After Phase 4 implementation, as part of Phase 5 verification          |
| **Who runs**   | Build agent during code review                                         |
| **Catches**    | Contract breaks, auth gaps, missing error handling, wrong status codes |

**How to add:**

```bash
# Test an API endpoint with curl:
source .dev-workflow/ports.env

# Test: POST /api/widget returns 201
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST "$SERVER_URL/api/widget" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "test"}')
STATUS=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | tail -1)
BODY=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | head -1)

if [ "$STATUS" = "201" ]; then
  echo "PASS: Create widget returns 201"
else
  echo "FAIL: Expected 201, got $STATUS"
fi
```

API tests can live inside E2E scripts (the curl-based sections) or as standalone scripts. For projects with many API endpoints, consider a dedicated `scripts/api/` directory.

### E2E Browser Tests (Phases 6-7 — e2e-test skill)

| Aspect         | Detail                                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What**       | Full user flows through the UI                                         |
| **Runner**     | agent-browser when its Chrome smoke test passes; otherwise skip        |
| **Scope**      | Login, navigation, form submission, visual state, multi-step flows     |
| **Convention** | `.claude/skills/e2e-test/scripts/<feature>-e2e.sh`                     |
| **When**       | Phase 7, after dogfood exploration (Phase 6) identifies what to cover  |
| **Who runs**   | Build agent (Phase 7-8) + CI/CD                                        |
| **Catches**    | Integration failures, UI regressions, flow breaks, visual state errors |

Before adding browser-level tests on macOS, run:

```bash
agent-browser navigate about:blank
```

If Google Chrome crashes with `_RegisterApplication`, `TransformProcessType`, or `abort() called`, treat browser automation as unavailable on that machine. Keep API/unit tests running and mark browser checks `SKIP` until Chrome or agent-browser is fixed locally.

**How to add:** Follow the E2E Script Pattern in Part 2.

### The Incremental Pattern

Features start with zero tests and build up through `/build` phases:

```
Phase 4 (implement)  → run project's unit tests (framework-level)
Phase 5 (review)     → API contract tests via e2e-test scripts
Phase 6 (dogfood)    → browser exploration when available, find gaps
Phase 7 (e2e)        → codify findings into e2e-test scripts
Phase 8 (review)     → run all e2e-test scripts + unit tests
```

Each layer catches different failure modes:

- **Unit tests** (framework) — logic errors, edge cases, data transforms
- **API tests** (e2e-test skill) — contract breaks, auth gaps, wrong status codes
- **E2E browser** (e2e-test skill) — integration failures, UI regressions, flow breaks

### When to Skip Layers

Not every project needs both e2e-test layers. Unit tests are always the project framework's responsibility — this table covers what the e2e-test skill should include:

| Project type               | API tests (curl) | E2E browser (optional)    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Full-stack web app         | Yes              | Yes                       |
| API-only service           | Yes              | Skip                      |
| CLI tool                   | Skip             | Skip                      |
| Static site / landing page | Skip             | E2E only                  |
| Library / package          | Skip             | Skip                      |
| Mobile app (API backend)   | Yes              | Skip (use native testing) |

---

## Part 4: Growing Tests With the Project

### Layer 0 — Walking Skeleton

For the first feature, focus on proving the test infrastructure works:

1. Create the workspace setup hook
2. Create the e2e-test skill with a single seed script
3. Write one E2E test that logs in and verifies the home page loads
4. Run it — if it passes, the infrastructure works

Don't worry about coverage. The goal is **one green test end-to-end**.

### Layer 1+ — Feature Development

Each subsequent feature adds tests via the e2e-test skill:

- New API endpoint → API contract test (curl in e2e-test script)
- New user flow → E2E browser test script when browser automation is healthy

Unit tests are added alongside code during Phase 4 using the project's test framework — the e2e-test skill doesn't manage these.

The build agent follows the e2e-test SKILL.md to know where to put scripts and what patterns to use.

### Evaluator Integration

In full mode (`/launch` with evaluator), the evaluator agent reads `.dev-workflow/feature-verification.json`. Verification steps should map to test assertions where possible:

```json
{
  "task": "Add user profile page",
  "verification_steps": [
    "GET /api/user/profile returns 200 with user data",
    "Profile page renders user name and email",
    "Edit profile form saves changes"
  ]
}
```

Each verification step becomes a test assertion — either in an API test (step 1) or E2E script (steps 2-3).

### CI/CD Integration

E2E scripts in `.claude/skills/e2e-test/scripts/` are designed to run in CI:

- Auto-source `ports.env` with fallback defaults
- Handle missing tools gracefully (SKIP, not FAIL)
- Exit 1 on any FAIL, exit 0 on all PASS/SKIP
- Self-contained — no shared state between scripts

Add them to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# Example: GitHub Actions
- name: Run E2E tests
  run: |
    for script in .claude/skills/e2e-test/scripts/*-e2e.sh; do
      echo "Running $script..."
      bash "$script" || exit 1
    done
```
